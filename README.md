### Additional Notes
I made this super quickly in order for it to be ready for valentines, so there is no config for this right now. Because of this, you can't change things like cooldowns, range, damage, or translate things yet. If people actually care, I can add a config. But this is like april fools pack, so don't take it seriously lol. I'd be happy enough if you install it on your server for the week then remove it.
